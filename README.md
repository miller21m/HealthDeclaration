# HealthDeclaration

Health Declaration...
This form has become a significant part of our daily routine (During Covie-19).
Every time that I'm going to my gym I am asked to fill out such a form.
The worst part is that it is done using pen and paper.
Imagine what it is like to fill out a form with a pen that everyone uses, especially these days...
So I decided to find an easy solution, I created a digital form.
When the trainee arrives to the gym there is a QR code which he can scan with his smartphone and then fill out the form online.
The full information is saved on the gym database including the exact time of entry.
In this way, the gym can store and manage all the health declarations easily.
